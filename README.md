# YAIM0425 d09b – Signals Network 📡🔗

## 📦 Description

**YAIM0425 d09b – Signals Network** introduces a global circuit network that allows **signals to be sent and received instantly from anywhere to anywhere**.

Signals can travel across **unlimited distances**, **between surfaces**, and even **between planets**, removing all physical restrictions normally present in circuit networks.

This MOD is designed for advanced automation, testing, and extreme logistics scenarios.

## ⚙️ How it works (Player view)

* Special entities allow signals to enter and exit the **global signals network**
* Any signal sent into the network becomes instantly available everywhere else
* Works across:

  * Unlimited distance
  * Different surfaces
  * Different planets
* Fully compatible with **red and green circuit wires**

Signals behave exactly like standard circuit network signals, just without distance limits.

## ⚠️ Warnings

* 🚨 **This MOD completely breaks circuit network limitations**
* 📡 Enables instant global logic and automation
* 🔁 **If `AAI Signal Transmission` by Earendel is also active, this MOD will replace its functionality while both are enabled**
* 🧪 Recommended for:

  * Sandbox and creative gameplay
  * Testing complex circuit setups
  * Late-game or experimental factories
* ❌ Not recommended for challenge-based or progression-focused playthroughs
